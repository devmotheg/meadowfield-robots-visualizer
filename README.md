# Meadowfield Robots Visualizer

This project is about four robots competing in an annual contest to see who is the fastest one out of all of them!

What inspired me to do this poject is a chapter in Eloquent's JavaScript book, it's pretty much just a neat visualization of it with some features added >:]
